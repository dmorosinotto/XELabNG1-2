# XELabNG1-2

This repo was born as codelab of [My session of 2nd Dec 2016](http://www.xedotnet.org/eventi/lab-angular-1-to-2-lab/) about migration from Angular 1.x to NG2

It use a simple sample the classic "Hello World" angular application, but with some small tricks to modernize it 
(like [Boostrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) styles and a little [directive](https://github.com/dmorosinotto/XELabNG1-2/blob/0-basics/src/app.js#L33-L55) to handle undo when you press ESC)


You'll find an **Intro Guide** [IT](docs/IT/ATeam.md) / [EN](docs/EN/ATeam.md) 
that explains the motivations and howto to evolve you code from $scope to NG2 [step-by-step!](https://github.com/dmorosinotto/XELabNG1-2/commits/ng2) 

 
 Even if you are not interested in the NG2 migration, I hope that you take the time to walkthrought this repo 
 possibly to learn a way to write better [Angular 1.x](https://angularjs.org/) app adopting 
 some common [best](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md)-[practices](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide), 
 and leveraging the power of [Typescipt](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [ng-metadata](https://github.com/ngParty/ng-metadata) 
 to have a cleaner codebase that will be ready for a migration to [NG2](https://angular.io/).

`With all my <3 for the Angular Community` :heart:
