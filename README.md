# XELabNG1-2

This repo was born as codelab for [my session of 2nd Dec 2016](http://www.xedotnet.org/eventi/lab-angular-1-to-2-lab/) about migration from Angular 1.x to NG2

It uses a simple sample: "the classic Hello World" angular application, but with some small tricks to modernize it 
(like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) styles and a little [directive](https://github.com/dmorosinotto/XELabNG1-2/blob/0-basics/src/app.js#L33-L55) to handle undo when you press ESC)

Here you'll find an **Intro Guide** [IT](docs/IT/ATeam.md) / [EN](docs/EN/ATeam.md) 
that explains the motivations and how to evolve you code from $scope to NG2 [step-by-step!](https://github.com/dmorosinotto/XELabNG1-2/commits/ng2) 
 
And one more thing: even if you are not interested in the [NG2](https://angular.io/) migration, 
I hope you can take the time to walk trought the commits, and possibly find/learn a "better way" to write an Angular 1.x app adopting 
 some common [best](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md)-[practices](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide), 
 and leveraging the power of [Typescipt](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [ng-metadata](https://github.com/ngParty/ng-metadata) 
 to have a cleaner codebase, even if you want to keep using [Angular 1.x](https://angularjs.org/).

`With all my <3 for the Angular Community` :sparkles::heart:
